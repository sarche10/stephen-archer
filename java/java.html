  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <br>
  <p>So, you want to learn how to code in Java.
     There are many different reasons you might want to learn how to code in Java, also there are many different ways 
     that you can learn. Like many other things in life, you can search 'Java tutorials' on Google and be presented with
     a vast number of different options. Why should you choose this option? I don't have any particular reason that you should, 
     I am just a former student sharing what I learned in college and through my own trials and errors. Some might find this website
     very helpful, while others might perfer websites such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a> or Youtube tutorials more beneficial.
    All of these are good and helpful, and it really just depends on personal preference.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>To get started, you're going to need an environment to code in. While you could just use a text file, I would highly recommend that you begin with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
        Most developers use an IDE to code, but there's always going to be the psychos out there that perfer the challenge of using plain ol' notepad. When I first began with Java, I used and still use 
        <a href = "https://www.eclipse.org/ide/"> Eclipse</a>. Although, there are many different IDE's out there and I'll leave that choice up to you. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Oh, also I won't be helping you set up your IDE because that is above my unpaid pay-grade. If you need help with getting an IDE up and running, I'll refer you to <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+install+an+IDE+for+java" >here</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Before we get started, a few other things to note. 1) No, Java and Javsascript are not the same thing and 2) Java is often compared to C# and C++, don't get them mixed up.</p>
