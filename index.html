               Hi! My name is Stephen Archer, and I am a software engineer that graduated from Kennesaw State University in 2023 with a Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering. This website is a personal project of mine that I will use to display my knowledge, skills, and share what I have learned with others. This website will constantly be under work and growing overtime - currently in the very beginner stages.  
               Currently, I am still looking for work so if you are an employer feel free to check out my resume 
               <a href="Resume.pdf" download="resume.pdf">here</a>.

            <p>
            Participated in a unique Capstone Project focused on the development of a reporting/analytics solution for 
            HoneyBaked Ham, Co. This project involved sourcing information from external sources and building a 
            flexible and dynamic dashboard using Power BI that allowed the business to monitor and manage KPI's 
            for store locations. Capstone teams met regularly with Honey Baked Ham IT and business personal 
            through the entire discovery and build process, following a very agile delivery process
